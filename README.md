Xylem Innovation Challenge 2025 - Project Ideas

Drone-Based Wildlife Rescue and Monitoring System for the Sundarbans
(Dual Challenge: Water-Related Disaster Management + Climate Resilience & Biodiversity Protection)
Objective:
Use AI-enabled drones with edge computing (RISC-V + FPGA) for real-time wildlife detection, tracking, and rescue coordination in disaster-impacted regions of the Sundarbans.

Key Features:
AI-Driven Wildlife Detection:


Onboard camera + thermal + IR sensors.


FPGA accelerates CNN models (e.g., YOLO, MobileNet) for detecting injured, stranded, or panicked animals in dense foliage.


Real-Time Tracking & Mapping:


RISC-V handles GPS tagging, path prediction, and sends location updates to forest division or rescue teams.


Edge processing minimizes data transmission, crucial in low-connectivity areas.


Disaster-Aware Navigation:


GIS and real-time weather data integration for dynamic drone pathing and safe operation.


Avoids flood zones, strong wind zones, etc.


Rescue Assistance:


Optional micro-drone swarm coordination to herd or guide animals.


Can drop lightweight emergency supplies (food, water, first-aid) to stranded wildlife.


Power & Communication:


Solar-recharging drone stations in key areas.


LPWAN/satellite communication for updates.



Impact:
Protect endangered species like the Bengal tiger, fishing cats, and estuarine crocodiles.


Minimize wildlife casualties during floods, cyclones, or tidal surges.


Create a model for drone-aided biodiversity protection in coastal forests worldwide.



Enhancement Suggestions:
Add a wildlife distress audio classifier (edge ML model) to pick up animal cries during disasters.


Include thermal image anomaly detection for spotting animals in night or fog conditions.


Develop a web-based dashboard for live monitoring and drone coordination by forest officials.
